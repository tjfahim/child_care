                    <b>At 1 year, solid foods – including healthy snacks – are now your child’s main source of energy and nutrition.</b> <br>
                    <b>He can take between three quarters to one cup of food three to four times a day, plus one to two snacks between meals.</b><br>
                    <b>Continue breastfeeding as much as your child wants, until he is at least 2 years old.</b><br>
                    <b>Avoid junk food and soft drinks.</b><br>
                    <p>At this age, breastmilk still provides important nutrition and protection against disease, but other foods become her main source of nutrition and energy. Feed her other foods first and then breastfeed after if she is still hungry.</p><br>
                    <h4 class="" style="color: green">What to feed your child</h4>

                    <p>
                        Your child can eat anything, so give her some of all the food your family eats and make every bite count. Each meal needs to be packed with nutritious food. <br>

                        Be sure she has a portion of animal foods (milk, dairy, eggs, meat, fish and poultry) each day, plus legumes (like chickpeas, lentils or peas) – or nuts, and orange or green vegetables and fruits. Add a little oil or fat to her food for energy.<br>
                        
                        Be sure your child’s snacks are healthy, such as fresh fruit.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="" style="color: green"> How much food and how often</h4>

                    <p>
                       
                        Your child can take between three quarters to one cup of food three to four times a day, plus one to two snacks between meals.<br>
                        
                        If you’re not breastfeeding, he’ll need to eat more often. At 1 year, about the time he’s starting to walk, your child's feeding schedule should include four to five meals a day, plus two healthy snacks. Milk products are a very important part of your child’s diet – give him one or two cups of milk a day.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="" style="color: green"> Foods to avoid</h4>

                    <p>
                       
                        Avoid junk food and soft drinks. Factory-made snacks like crisps, cookies, cakes, soda and candy are unhealthy. They have high amounts of sugar, salt, fat and chemicals, and take up space in your child’s stomach that should be filled with nutritious foods.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="" style="color: green">Mealtime tips</h4>

                    <p>
                        
Having his own bowl of food will help your child learn to feed himself. Start as soon as he wants. Give him all the food he needs and plenty of time to eat. <br>

At first, he’ll be slow and messy. Help him so that he gets most of the food in his mouth (instead of on himself or the floor!). Encourage him to finish it and make sure he has had enough. <br>

Give your child lots of love and encouragement to eat during meal times.<br>

Sit in front of him and make eye contact. Interact with your child, smile at him, talk to him and praise him for eating.

Make the meal a happy time!
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="" style="color: green"> What to do when your child refuses to eat solid foods</h4>

                    <p>
                       
Make sure she is hungry at mealtimes and has not just had a snack. Although breastfeeding continues to be healthy for your child, breastfeed her only after her meal. At this age, she should eat solid food first. 
<br>
Give your child healthy food that she likes or mix the food she likes with food she doesn’t like as much. Try different food combinations and textures.
<br>
If she still refuses, don’t force or pressure her to eat, and don’t be tempted to give her junk food instead.
<br>
Be calm and accepting. Give your child positive attention when she does eat, but don’t make it a problem when she doesn’t eat. Just take the food away, cover it, and offer it to her again a bit later.

                        <b>​It's important to help your children develop a healthy attitude toward eating at an early age. By age three, children are less likely to use eating—or not eating—to be defiant. Generally, (although almost certainly not always), they will learn to better interact, participate, and enjoy family meals.  </b><br>
                        <h4 class="" style="color: green">5 Tips for Parents:</h4>

                      <p>
                        
                       <b> Accept strong preferences about foods.</b> Your three-year-old may be enthusiastic about eating, but he or she may have very specific food preferences. Some preferences may vary from day to day. For example, your child may gobble down a particular food one day, and then push away the same food the next day. She may ask for a certain food for several days in a row, and then insist that she doesn't like it anymore. As irritating as this behavior can feel, it is very typical for a three-year-old. It is best not to make an issue of it. Instead, continue to offer a variety of healthy foods, and let your child choose which of them and how much he or she will eat.<br>

                       <b> Encourage, but don't force trying new foods.</b> Offer very small amounts of a new food for your child to taste (an "adventure bite"), along with other foods he or she already likes. Do not expect your child to eat a full portion of an unfamiliar food.<br>

                       <b>Offer nutritious food choices at every meal.</b> As a parent, your job is to make sure that your three-year-old has nutritious food choices at every meal. After offering healthy options at the table, let him or her make the decision of how much to eat. If your child shows picky eating preferences—resisting vegetables, for example—don't get discouraged or frustrated. Keep offering a variety of healthy foods, even if your child did not like them before. Developing a taste for foods can require up to 15-20 repeated exposures. This is also an important time to establish healthy snacking and meal habits.<br>
                        
                       <b> Meals can be simple and nutritious.</b> Remember, meals at this age don't need to be fancy. In fact, most three-year-olds prefer simpler preparation. If you only a few minutes to prepare a meal, try simple meals that include a protein source, whole grain, fruit, vegetable, and dairy. For example, a turkey or peanut butter sandwich, a serving of carrots, an apple, and a glass of milk. A simple lunch like this takes less time to prepare than driving through a fast-food restaurant—and it is much healthier!<br>
                        
                       <b> Turn off the TV—especially at mealtimes.</b> Television advertising can be a big challenge to your three-year-old's good nutrition. Young children are easily influenced by ads for unhealthy foods like sugary cereals, fast food, and sweets. The best way to avoid this is put in place a "media curfew" at mealtime and bedtime, putting all devices away or plugging them into a charging station for the night.

                    <p>Children feel better when they eat well. During the preschool and kindergarten years, your child should be eating the same foods as the rest of the family.

                        Your job as a parent is to offer foods with nutritional value in a calm environment and to have regular times for eating. Your child's job is to decide whether he or she is hungry and how much food to eat when it's offered.</p>
                    <h4 class="" style="color: green">8 Tips for Parents:</h4>

                    <p>
                       <b> Offer a range of healthy foods.</b> When children eat a variety of foods, they get a balance of the vitamins they need to grow. Healthy options include fresh vegetables and fruits, low-fat dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheeses) or dairy substitutes, lean proteins (beans, chicken, turkey, fish, lean hamburger, tofu, eggs), and whole-grain cereals and bread. <br>
                        
                       <b> Don't expect children to "clean their plates."</b> Serve appropriate portion sizes, but do not expect your child to always eat everything served. Even better, let your children choose their own portion sizes. It is okay if children do not eat everything on their plates. At this age, they should learn to know when they are full. Some four-year-olds may still be picky eaters. Parents can encourage their children to try new foods, but they should not pressure eating.
                        <br>
                        <b> Offer regular meal times and sit together.</b> Serve foods at regular meal and snack times. Try to be careful to not offer foods between these eating times. Children who are eating or "grazing" throughout the day may not be hungry at mealtimes, when healthier foods tend to be available. When it is meal or snack time, turn off the TV, and eat together at the table. This helps create a calm environment for eating. 
                        <br>
                        <b>Limit processed food and sugary drinks.</b> Another parent role is to limit how much processed food is in the house and to limit fast food. Most important is to limit sugary drinks. Sugary drinks include soda, juice drinks, lemonade, sweet tea, and sports drinks. Sugary drinks can lead to cavities and unhealthy weight gain.
                        <br>
                        <b>  The best drinks are water and milk.</b> The best drinks for children are water and milk (including non-dairy milk). Milk provides calcium and vitamin D to build strong bones. Ice cream is okay once in a while, but it should not be offered every day. Whole fruit is preferable to fruit juice—even if it is 100% juice—as juice is a concentrated source of sugar and low in fiber. If you offer juice, make it 100% fruit juice and limit it to 4 oz. or less per day. It is best to serve juice with a meal, as juice is more likely to cause cavities when served between meals.
                        <br>
                        <b>Small portions for small children.</b> It is important to pay attention to portion sizes. Four- and five-year-olds need smaller servings than adults. Encourage your children to choose their own serving size, but use smaller plates, bowls, and cups. See Energy In: Recommended Food & Drink Amounts for Children.
                        <br>
                        <b> Turn off the TV—especially at mealtimes.</b> Television advertising can be a big challenge to your child's good nutrition. Four- and five-year-olds are easily influenced by ads for unhealthy foods like sugary cereals, fast food, and sweets. The best way to avoid this is put in place a "media curfew" at mealtime and bedtime, putting all devices away or plugging them into a charging station for the night.
                        <br>
                        <b> Teach table manners.</b> At this age, your child should be ready to learn basic table manners. By age four, he or she will no longer grip the fork or spoon in his or her fist and be able to hold them like an adult. With your help, he or she can begin learning the proper use of a table knife. You can also teach other table manners, such as not talking with a full mouth, using a napkin, and not reaching across another person's plate. While it's necessary to explain these rules, it's much more important to model them. Your child will watch to see how the rest of the family is behaving and follow their lead. It's easier to develop table manners if you have a family custom of eating together. Make at least one meal a day a special and pleasant family time. Have your child set the table or help in some other way in preparing the meal.</p>
