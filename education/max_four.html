                    Hi. I’m Dino, the family dog. I help keep people safe,
                    especially on the roads. Take a look at my diary to see what
                    I did last week.

                    <b>Sunday</b>

                    Some children really don’t think. Our neighbour’s boy ran in
                    front of a car to get his ball. The car almost hit him. I
                    saved him though. Remember, always look and listen
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Monday</b>

                    Walking on the street at night can be very dangerous,
                    especially if you wear dark clothes. Car drivers can’t see
                    you very well, just like these two I had to take home.
                    Luckily I never go out without my reflective jacket and
                    collar. Remember, BE SEEN!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Tuesday</b>

                    People can get very angry when driving, usually for silly
                    reasons. One driver started shouting at Mum today when she
                    stopped to let some children cross the road. I soon made him
                    stop.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Wednesday</b>

                    One thing makes me really mad. Grrrrrr. People walking on a
                    dangerous road when they can walk on the safe pavement. I
                    saw two girls doing that today but I soon made them change
                    their minds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Thursday</b>

                    Seat belts can save your life! I make sure everyone in our
                    car wears their seat belt. If they forget, I soon remind
                    them. Even I’ve got one.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Friday</b>

                    I like Fridays. The roads are quieter. But you still have to
                    be careful. I caught Dad talking on his mobile phone while
                    driving. I soon stopped him though. Don’t worry, he got his
                    phone back.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Saturday</b>

                    Today Mum took me for a walk. One car was parked in a very
                    dangerous place. It was right on the corner of the street.
                    Don’t worry though. I left him a message!

                    It’s a special day at the ABC Zoo. A new animal is here.
                    ‘What’s in it?’<br />
                    ‘It’s a zorilla from Africa. She needs a home.’ ‘Mmm,
                    zorilla, eh? OK, let’s find you a home.’ <br />
                    ‘Let’s see. An aardvark, a boa constrictor, a coyote and a
                    duck-billed platypus. The zorilla doesn’t go here.’<br />
                    ‘Let’s see. An emu, a flamingo, a giraffe and a hyena. The
                    zorilla doesn’t go here.’<br />
                    ‘Let’s see. An impala, a jellyfish, a koala and a lemur. The
                    zorilla doesn’t go here.’<br />
                    ‘Let’s see. A meerkat, a narwhal, an orangutan and a puma.
                    The zorilla doesn’t go here.’<br />
                    ‘Let’s see. A quetzal, a rhea, a sloth and a tarantula. The
                    zorilla doesn’t go here.’<br />
                    ‘Let’s see. An umbrella bird, a vulture and a walrus. The
                    zorilla doesn’t go here.’<br />
                    ‘Let’s see. A xenops, a yak, a zorilla! Here’s your
                    home!’<br />

                    Ali and the magic carpet
                  </h4>

                  <p>
                    One very hot day Ali finds a carpet in his uncle’s shop.
                    ‘What’s this?’<br />
                    Suddenly the carpet jumps! It moves and flies off into the
                    air. ‘Hey! What’s happening?’<br />
                    A loud booming voice comes from the carpet. ‘Welcome, O
                    master. I am a magic carpet.’<br />
                    First they fly high up into the sky and then they land in a
                    jungle. It is hot and wet and it’s raining. ‘It’s raining!
                    Yuck!’<br />
                    Then they fly to the desert. It is very, very hot and dry.
                    ‘It is very, very hot today!’<br />
                    After that they fly to the South Pole. There is lots of ice
                    and snow. It’s freezing. ‘Brrr!’<br />
                    ‘Where are we now? I can’t see!’<br />
                    ‘In the mountains. Can you see me?’<br />
                    ‘It’s very foggy.’<br />
                    Then they fly to a forest. It’s very windy there. <br />
                    ‘Oh, it’s windy in the forest!’<br />
                    Then they fly to an island in the sea. There is thunder and
                    lightning. ‘Aaagh! Let’s go home!’<br />
                    ‘What a storm!’<br />
                    Finally they fly back home. The carpet lands in the shop and
                    Ali gets off. ‘Wow! What an adventure!’

                  <p>
                    Billy was getting excited. It was the day of the circus!
                    Billy loved the circus – all the animals and the people. It
                    was so much fun! <br />
                    At eight o’clock Billy and his parents arrived at the huge
                    red and white striped tent called the ‘Big Top’.<br />
                    The ringmaster shouted with his huge booming voice, ‘Good
                    evening, ladies and gentlemen!’<br />
                    Then the lights went up to the top of the tent and Billy saw
                    a man and a woman dressed in sparkly clothes balancing on a
                    huge swing. They flew through the air. ‘Ooooo!’ shouted the
                    people every time they flew. It was very, very exciting.<br />
                    A door opened and the lions bounced into the ring – there
                    were six of them all looking huge and fierce and dangerous.
                    The man in the middle was the lion tamer. Billy watched as
                    he put his head in the biggest lion’s mouth. ‘Ooooo!’
                    shouted the people in horror and amazement.<br />
                    After the lions came the clowns. They were wearing brightly
                    coloured clothes – blue and yellow and red with spots of
                    green. They had red noses and painted faces and funny red
                    hair. They fell over, told lots of jokes and did lots of
                    very silly things. ‘Ha, ha, ha!’ laughed the people – and
                    Billy laughed too. Finally the elephants arrived in the ring
                    - there were three enormous grey elephants and one smaller
                    one. The small one balanced on one leg and did lots of
                    tricks.<br />
                    Then it stopped and looked up at Billy. ‘Hello,’ said Billy
                    to the elephant. ‘I’m Billy.’ ‘I’m Minny,’ replied the
                    elephant to Billy’s surprise.<br />
                    Then suddenly the small elephant turned around and ran
                    towards the door of the tent. It ran out of the tent into
                    the street and off into the town. All the people rushed out
                    of the circus tent screaming, ‘Aagh! The elephant – it’s
                    escaped!’<br />
                    ‘Help!’ cried the ringmaster. ‘Minny the elephant has
                    escaped!’<br />
                    Minny was a very happy elephant. It was the first time she
                    had been out of the circus! It felt good to be free!<br />
                    She ran along the main street towards the main square. She
                    saw the fountain in the middle of the square. She climbed
                    into the big fountain and sat down in the water. <br />
                    People tried to walk by but Minny sprayed water at them
                    using her huge trunk! ‘Oh, this is much more fun than the
                    circus!’ cried Minny.<br />
                    After a while Minny decided to explore. She went along the
                    street and into the big supermarket. All the people who saw
                    Minny ran out of the supermarket screaming! Minny had a
                    wonderful time – she helped herself to the bananas and
                    scoffed a large chocolate cake, ten packets of biscuits and
                    a large number of buns.<br />
                    When she had finished eating Minny decided to explore again
                    so she went out into the street. In the distance Minny saw a
                    big house, but there was something strange about it – there
                    was a red light all around it.<br />
                    Minny got nearer to the house and then she heard the people
                    in the house shouting and screaming. ‘Help!’ they shouted.
                    ‘Save us!’<br />
                    Minny rushed into the garden opposite the house. There was a
                    big pond with lots of water. She put her trunk in the water
                    and took in as much water as she could. Then she rushed over
                    to the house and sprayed the house with water. She did this
                    many times and the flames and fire died away.<br />
                    From the top window Minny could see a small boy. He opened
                    the window and Minny took him out of the house using her
                    trunk.<br />
                    ‘Minny!’ he cried. ‘It’s me!’<br />
                    ‘Hello, Billy,’ said the elephant.<br />
                    ‘You saved me!’ cried Billy. ‘You are the bravest elephant
                    in the world!’<br />
                    Billy’s mother and father came rushing out of the house.
                    They couldn’t believe what they saw! Billy was safe and
                    their house was safe – and all because of an elephant.<br />
                    The next day all the people in the town made a crowd outside
                    the town hall. They gave Minny the elephant a special medal.
                    Billy rode around the square on Minny’s back, waving and
                    smiling at all the people.<br /><br />
                    They went slowly back to the circus to rejoin the other
                    elephants. Minny was so happy that she never wanted to
                    escape from the circus again.

                  <h4 class="" style="color: green">Isaac Newton</h4>

                  <p>
                    Isaac Newton was born in Lincolnshire, England in 1643,
                    where he grew up on a farm. When he was a boy, he made lots
                    of brilliant inventions like a windmill to grind corn, a
                    water clock and a sundial. <br />
                    However, Isaac didn’t get brilliant marks at school.<br />
                    When he was 18, Isaac went to study at Cambridge University.
                    He was very interested in physics, mathematics and
                    astronomy. But in 1665 the Great Plague, which was a
                    terrible disease, spread in England, and Cambridge
                    University had to close down. Isaac returned home to the
                    farm.<br />
                    Isaac continued studying and experimenting at home. One day
                    he was drinking a cup of tea in the garden. He saw an apple
                    fall from a tree.<br />
                    ‘Why do apples fall down instead of up?’<br />
                    From this, he formed the theory of gravity. Gravity is an
                    invisible force which pulls objects towards<br />
                    the Earth and keeps the planets moving around the Sun.<br />
                    Isaac was fascinated by light. He discovered that white
                    light is in fact made up of all the colours of the rainbow.
                    Isaac also invented a special reflecting telescope, using
                    mirrors. It was much more powerful than other telescopes.<br />
                    Isaac made another very important discovery, which he called
                    his ‘Three Laws of Motion’. These laws explain how objects
                    move. Isaac’s laws are still used today for sending rockets
                    into space.<br />
                    Thanks to his discoveries, Isaac became rich and famous.
                    However, he had a bad temper and often argued with other
                    scientists.<br />
                    ‘You stole my discovery!’<br />
                    Sir Isaac Newton died in 1727 aged 85. He was buried along
                    with English kings and queens in Westminster Abbey in
                    London. He was one of the greatest scientists and
                    mathematicians who has ever lived
