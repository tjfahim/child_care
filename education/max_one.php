                    AGE/STAGE: Babies 4-6 Months
                  </h4>

                  <p>
                    The AAP recommends that an infant not be started on solid
                    foods until after 6 months of age. Many pediatricians still
                    start babies on solids around 4 months of age. This chart
                    accommodates all ages and stages up to 12 months.
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>CEREALS</b>

                    Rice and Oatmeal cereals are the least of the allergenic
                    grains and thus most babies are started out with those
                    cereals. You don’t HAVE to start with cereal – try avocado
                    instead or banana.<br />
                    <b>FRUITS</b>

                    May be served raw after 8 months old or earlier if the
                    fruits are soft and baby does not have digestion troubles –
                    bananas and avocados do NOT need to be cooked ever.<br />
                    <b>VEGGIES</b>

                    Always serve cooked until after 12 months old or when baby
                    can chew well enough so that no choking hazard is
                    present.<br />
                    <b>PROTEIN</b>

                    Always serve cooked with no pink areas – NEVER give a small
                    baby/child raw meat or fish<br />
                    <b>DAIRY</b>

                    NEVER replace breast milk or formula until after 12 months
                    of age – serious health risks are possible. Never give a
                    child under the age of 2yrs old low fat or skim milk
                    products; whole milk is necessary.<br /><br />

                    When thinking about starting baby on solid foods and
                    introducing solids to baby, a good rule of thumb is to
                    “Watch the Baby – Not the Calendar”. This is true when
                    introducing solid foods (complementary foods) for both
                    breastfed and formula fed infants. Just because baby has
                    turned 4 months old does not mean she must be introduced to
                    solid foods. <br /><br />

                    <b>
                      How much will your 4 month – 6 month old baby eat at his
                      first meal?</b
                    ><br />
                    Babies will probably only eat 1/2 of a tablespoon portion of
                    food the very first times you begin solids. Don’t expect
                    your baby to “finish” a meal; remember this is a new
                    experience for your baby. As your baby gets older and is
                    eating more solids, you will gradually increase the portion
                    sizes. Also, keep in mind that breast milk and/or infant
                    formula are providing for the total nutrition of your baby
                    at this stage.

                  <b class="" style="color: green">Breastmilk continues</b>

                  <p>
                    At 6 months of age, breastmilk continues to be a vital
                    source of nutrition; but it’s not enough by itself. You need
                    to now introduce your baby to solid food, in addition to
                    breastmilk, to keep up with her growing needs. <br />

                    Be sure you give your baby her first foods after she has
                    breastfed, or between nursing sessions, so that your baby
                    continues to breastfeed as much as possible.<br />

                    When you start to feed your baby solid food, take extra care
                    that she doesn’t become sick. As she crawls about and
                    explores, germs can spread from her hands to her mouth.
                    Protect your baby from getting sick by washing your and her
                    hands with soap before preparing food and before every
                    feeding.
                  </p>
                  <b class="" style="color: green"
                    >Feeding your baby: 6–8 months old</b
                  >

                  <p>
                    From 6–8 months old, feed your baby half a cup of soft food
                    two to three times a day. Your baby can eat anything except
                    honey, which she shouldn't eat until she is a year old. You
                    can start to add a healthy snack, like mashed fruit, between
                    meals. As your baby gets increasing amounts of solid foods,
                    she should continue to get the same amount of breastmilk.
                  </p>
                  <b class="" style="color: green"
                    >Feeding your baby: 9–11 months old</b
                  >

                  <p>
                    From 9–11 months old, your baby can take half a cup of food
                    three to four times a day, plus a healthy snack. Now you can
                    start to chop up soft food into small pieces instead of
                    mashing it. Your baby may even start to eat food herself
                    with her fingers. Continue to breastfeed whenever your baby
                    is hungry.<br />

                    Each meal needs to be both easy for your baby to eat and
                    packed with nutrition. Make every bite count.<br />

                    Foods need to be rich in energy and nutrients. In addition
                    to grains and potatoes, be sure your baby has vegetables and
                    fruits, legumes and seeds, a little energy-rich oil or fat,
                    and – especially – animal foods (dairy, eggs, meat, fish and
                    poultry) every day. Eating a variety of foods every day
                    gives your baby the best chance of getting all the nutrients
                    he needs.
                    <br />
                    If your baby refuses a new food or spits it out, don’t force
                    it. Try again a few days later. You can also try mixing it
                    with another food that your baby likes or squeezing a little
                    breastmilk on top.

                  <p>
                    If you're not breastfeeding your baby, she’ll need to eat
                    more often. She'll also need to rely on other foods,
                    including milk products, to get all the nutrition her body
                    needs.<br />

                    Start to give your baby solid foods at 6 months of age, just
                    as a breastfed baby would need. Begin with two to three
                    spoonfuls of soft and mashed food four times a day, which
                    will give her the nutrients she needs without breastmilk.<br />
                    From 6–8 months old, she’ll need half a cup of soft food
                    four times a day, plus a healthy snack. <br />
                    From 9–11 months old, she’ll need half a cup of food four to
                    five times a day, plus two healthy snacks.

                    At 6 months of age babies are not able to digest all types
                    of food until they reached the milestone of 12 months.
                    However, there are a few special foods that can help in the
                    development and weight gain of 6-month-old babies. In
                    contrast to what you might think, 6-month-old babies don’t
                    need to eat more to gain weight. <br />It’s quality over
                    quantity that matters when it comes to your baby’s meals.
                    The following foods are great for helping your 6-month-old
                    baby gain weight:
                  </p>
                  <h4 class="" style="color: green">
                    Pureed Fruits And Vegetables
                  </h4>

                  <p>
                    Fruits and vegetables are excellent sources of vitamins,
                    minerals, and antioxidants. They also contain dietary fiber,
                    which is important for proper digestion. You can start with
                    pureed fruits like bananas, avocados, sweet potatoes, and
                    pumpkins. You can also give pureed vegetables like carrots,
                    peas, and green beans. These purees can be given along with
                    cereals or as a separate meal. You can gradually increase
                    the quantity as per your baby’s tolerance.
                  </p>
                  <h4 class="" style="color: green">Egg Yolk</h4>

                  <p>
                    Egg yolk is an excellent source of nutrients like choline,
                    biotin, and vitamins A, D, and E. It also contains
                    high-quality protein and fat that help in the weight gain of
                    babies. You can start by giving your baby a little bit of
                    egg yolk mixed with breast milk or formula. However, for
                    your baby’s diet egg yolk should only be given in small
                    amounts as it contains cholesterol. Eggs are a powerhouse of
                    nutrients and are one of the best foods you can give to your
                    6-month-old baby for weight gain.
                  </p>
                  <h4 class="" style="color: green">Yogurt</h4>

                  <p>
                    Yogurt is another excellent food for weight gain in babies.
                    It’s packed with nutrients like calcium, protein, and
                    vitamins that are essential for your baby’s growth and
                    development. Plus, the live cultures present in yogurt help
                    in strengthening your baby’s immune system. You can start by
                    giving your baby plain yogurt or yogurt mixed with some
                    fruits or vegetables. However, make sure to choose yogurt
                    that doesn’t contain any added sugar. You can make this
                    nutritious snack even more wholesome by adding some
                    whole-grain cereal to it. Start with 1-2 tablespoons of
                    yogurt and increase the amount gradually.
                  </p>
                  <h4 class="" style="color: green">Cheese</h4>

                  <p>
                    Cheese is another great food for weight gain in babies. It’s
                    rich in calories, fat, and protein, all of which are
                    essential for your baby’s growth and development. Cheese
                    also contains calcium, phosphorus, and other minerals that
                    are important for your baby’s health. You can start by
                    giving your baby small pieces of cheese to gnaw on. You can
                    also add grated cheese to other dishes like pasta, rice,
                    etc. Always remember to choose cheese that is easy to digest
                    and has a lower fat content. You can make it even healthier
                    by opting for cheese made from skimmed milk.

                  <h4 class="" style="color: green">Avocado</h4>

                  <p>
                    Avocado is not only a delicious fruit but also an excellent
                    source of healthy fats. It contains oleic acid, a
                    monounsaturated fat that helps in the absorption of
                    fat-soluble vitamins and carotenoids. Avocados are also rich
                    in fiber, which promotes a feeling of fullness. You can
                    start by giving your baby a quarter of an avocado and then
                    increasing the amount gradually. You can also add avocado to
                    other dishes like mashed potatoes or pureed vegetables.
                    However, make sure to avoid adding salt or sugar to it
                    because it can be harmful to your baby’s health.

                  <h4 class="" style="color: green">Fish</h4>

                  <p>
                    Generally, fish is not recommended for babies until they are
                    a year old. But, if your baby is 6 months old and
                    underweight, then you can give him/her fish once or twice a
                    week. Fish is an excellent source of protein and omega-3
                    fatty acids. These nutrients are extremely important for the
                    development of your baby’s brain and nervous system. You can
                    give your baby fish in the form of soup or puree. For the 6
                    months of age babies, you can try salmon, tilapia, or cod
                    fish. These are soft and easy to digest. You can also give
                    your baby canned tuna, but make sure to drain out all the
                    water completely.

                  <h4 class="" style="color: green">Mashed Or Pureed Meat</h4>

                  <p>
                    For easy digestion and to get all the nutrients, it is
                    advisable to give mashed or pureed meat to your 6-month-old
                    baby. You can either give them chicken, lamb, beef, or
                    turkey. All these meats are a rich source of proteins and
                    help in the growth and development of your baby. You can
                    either steam or bake the meat before mashing or pureeing it.
                    This will help to retain all the nutrients. You can add a
                    little water, broth, or formula to get the required
                    consistency. On the contrary, it can be introduced as a
                    semi-solid food as well.

                  <h4 class="" style="color: green">Sweet Potato</h4>

                  <p>
                    Baby weight is something that needs to be increased
                    gradually and in a healthy way. And, sweet potatoes can do
                    wonders in this case! They are rich in fiber, vitamins A, C,
                    B6, and Manganese. Also, they have a low glycemic index
                    which means that they break down slowly and help in
                    maintaining the blood sugar levels. You can either bake or
                    steam sweet potatoes and then puree them to make a smooth
                    paste. You can even mix it with other vegetables like
                    carrots, peas, or green beans to make a healthy and tasty
                    dish for your baby. To the sweet potato puree, you can even
                    add some breast milk or formula to make it more nutritious.
